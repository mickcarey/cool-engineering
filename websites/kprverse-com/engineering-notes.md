# Technical Implementation Notes ‚öôÔ∏è

## Framework & Architecture

**Vue.js/Nuxt.js Stack**
- Evidence: `data-v-` attributes in the HTML
- Server-side rendering for performance
- Component-based architecture for maintainability

**Storyblok CMS Integration**
- Content management system for dynamic content
- Allows non-technical updates while maintaining the design system
- Smart choice for a narrative-driven site

## CSS Architecture

**CSS Custom Properties (Variables)**
- Extensive use for theming and consistency
- Likely enables easy theme switching or customization
- Maintainable color and spacing systems

**Responsive Design Strategy**
- Mobile-first or mobile-considered approach
- Breakpoint-based layout adjustments
- Console aesthetic maintained across devices

## Performance Considerations

**Component Lazy Loading**
- Likely using Vue's async components
- Progressive loading aligns with the narrative experience
- Reduces initial bundle size

**Asset Optimization**
- Modern build tools (probably Webpack via Nuxt)
- Image optimization for web
- Strategic loading of resources

## Web3 Integration Points

**Blockchain Connectivity**
- Token/NFT integration mentioned
- Wallet connection capabilities
- Smart contract interactions (likely Ethereum-based)

## Technical Patterns of Interest

**State Management**
- Probably using Vuex or Pinia for state
- Manages the "system" state across components
- Handles user authentication and Web3 connections

**Animation & Transitions**
- CSS transitions for smooth state changes
- Possibly using Vue's transition components
- Careful timing to maintain the "system" illusion

## Development Architecture

**Modular Component Design**
- Reusable "console" components
- Typography system components
- Layout containers that maintain the aesthetic

**Build Process**
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+)
- Automated deployments
- Environment-based configurations

## What We Can Learn

The technical choices all serve the narrative. They didn't just build a website - they built a *system* that happens to run in a browser. Every technical decision reinforces the user experience story. üîß
