**Discovered**: September 2025
**Vibe**: Cyberpunk console meets Web3 storytelling

## The Hook

Landing on this site feels like you've just hacked into some futuristic terminal. It's not just a website - it's an *experience*. The loading screens, the console-style text, the gradual reveal of information... everything screams "you're entering a digital world."

## What Caught My Eye

- **Narrative Interface**: The site tells a story through its UI, not just content
- **Console Aesthetic**: Heavy monospace fonts, terminal-like interactions
- **Immersive Loading**: Those "initializing..." screens aren't just pretty - they set the mood
- **Web3 Integration**: Seamlessly blends blockchain concepts into the narrative

## Tech Stack Glimpses

- Vue.js/Nuxt.js frontend
- Storyblok CMS for content management
- Responsive design with clean mobile adaptation
- Modern CSS with extensive use of custom properties

## Why It's Worth Studying

This isn't just another portfolio site - it's a masterclass in *experience design*. They've created a cohesive digital world where every interaction reinforces the brand narrative. It's what happens when you take UI design and ask "but what if this was a story?"

Perfect example of how technical interfaces can be both functional *and* magical. âœ¨
