# Website Analysis Collection 🌐

*A curiosity cabinet of digital experiences worth studying*

## What Lives Here

This directory houses deep dives into websites that caught my attention - dissecting their design, engineering, and the magic that makes them tick. Think of it as reverse-engineering digital experiences for fun and learning!

## Analysis Structure

Each website gets its own folder with these components:

- **overview.md** - First impressions and summary
- **design-analysis.md** - Visual design breakdown
- **engineering-notes.md** - Technical implementation details
- **interactions.md** - UX patterns and user interactions
- **inspiration.md** - Ideas we can borrow or build upon

## Sites in the Collection

### 🎮 [kprverse.com](./kprverse-com/)
