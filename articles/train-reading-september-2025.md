## üß¨ Slime Molds: Nature's Genius Without a Brain

*Originally published in Scientific American ‚Ä¢ September 2025*

Picture this: a bright yellow blob that looks like someone sneezed scrambled eggs onto a log. No brain. No nervous system. Not even a single neuron to its name. And yet, this gelatinous genius‚Äîthe slime mold *Physarum polycephalum*‚Äîcan solve mazes, remember past events, and even recreate Tokyo's rail network more efficiently than human engineers.

Scientists have been having an absolute field day with these things. They've made slime molds solve the traveling salesman problem (a classic computational nightmare), anticipate periodic events like a tiny blob-shaped alarm clock, and even exhibit what looks suspiciously like learning behavior. One researcher at Princeton built a slime mold computer that can solve optimization problems. Another team discovered they can "teach" each other by fusing together and sharing knowledge like some kind of primordial Wikipedia.

**The mind-bender:** When scientists recreated ancient trade routes using slime molds and oat flakes (their favorite snack), the mold's networks almost perfectly matched the Silk Road. A brainless blob independently discovered the same solution that took humanity centuries of exploration and commerce to develop.

**The existential crisis:** If intelligence doesn't require a brain, what exactly IS intelligence? And should we be worried that our future AI overlords might look more like cafeteria mystery meat than Terminators?

## üï≥Ô∏è The Wikipedia Rabbit Hole Olympics

*Digital Culture Weekly ‚Ä¢ September 2025*

You know that thing where you look up "How tall is Tom Cruise?" and three hours later you're reading about 14th-century Mongolian horse breeding techniques? Congratulations, you've participated in humanity's favorite involuntary sport: competitive Wikipedia diving.

There's now an actual game called "Wikiracing" where players compete to navigate from one Wikipedia article to another using only internal links. The record for getting from "Harry Potter" to "Bacon" is six clicks (Harry Potter ‚Üí Scotland ‚Üí Wars of Scottish Independence ‚Üí Edward I of England ‚Üí History of the Jews in England ‚Üí Kashrut ‚Üí Bacon). Someone mapped this. Someone has a spreadsheet.

But here's where it gets properly weird: Researchers analyzing millions of Wikipedia sessions discovered that nearly all paths lead to Philosophy. Click the first link in any Wikipedia article's main text (ignoring stuff in parentheses), keep clicking the first link in each subsequent article, and 97% of the time you'll end up at Philosophy within 35 clicks. It's like all human knowledge is just desperately trying to become existential.

**Peak rabbit hole achievement:** A Reddit user documented their journey from "Pok√©mon" to "18th century French agriculture" in just 12 clicks, passing through nuclear physics, the Hapsburg monarchy, and somehow, Danny DeVito.

**The universal truth:** We're all just one hyperlink away from learning something we absolutely didn't need to know but now can't stop thinking about.

## ü™ñ The Great Emu War of 1932: Australia's Most Embarrassing Military Defeat

*History's Weird Moments Quarterly ‚Ä¢ September 2025*

In 1932, the Australian military declared war on emus. The emus won.

No, seriously. This actually happened. After WWI, the Australian government encouraged veterans to farm wheat in Western Australia. Nobody told the 20,000 emus who decided these farms looked like an all-you-can-eat buffet. The birds‚Äîessentially feathered velociraptors with a taste for wheat‚Äîdescended upon the crops like a biblical plague with better fashion sense.

The farmers begged for help. The government's solution? Send in the military with machine guns. What could go wrong?

**Everything. Everything went wrong.**

Major G.P.W. Meredith led the assault with two Lewis machine guns and 10,000 rounds of ammunition. The emus, displaying tactical genius that would make Sun Tzu weep with joy, immediately scattered into small groups, posted sentries, and basically invented guerrilla warfare on the spot. After a month, having used thousands of rounds, the military had killed... maybe 200 emus. The emus had destroyed 20,000 hectares of crops.

The best part? The media coverage. Headlines like "Emu War: Feathered Foes Prove Formidable" and one ornithologist's observation that "The machine-gunners' dreams of point-blank fire into masses of emus were soon dissipated. The birds scattered in all directions."

**The official military report's most Australian sentence ever:** "If we had a military division with the bullet-carrying capacity of these birds, it would face any army in the world."

**The aftermath:** The emus kept their territory. The government issued bounties instead. Australia still hasn't signed a peace treaty with the emus, technically making this the longest ongoing conflict in Australian history.

## üëÅÔ∏è Why We Can't Stop Watching People Make Things on the Internet

*Digital Anthropology Today ‚Ä¢ September 2025*

It's 2 AM. You told yourself you'd go to bed three hours ago. Instead, you're watching a Japanese craftsman spend 47 minutes hand-forging a single kitchen knife, and you're RIVETED. You don't cook. You don't need a knife. You don't even speak Japanese. But here you are, holding your breath as he quenches the blade.

Welcome to the hypnotic world of "process porn"‚Äîthe internet's most wholesome addiction. Whether it's primitive technology channels (man makes hut from scratch using only sticks and determination), restoration videos (rusty mess becomes shiny treasure), or those inexplicably satisfying hydraulic press compilations, we're collectively obsessed with watching people make stuff.

Psychologists think it's hitting some deep evolutionary button. For 99.9% of human history, watching skilled craftspeople was how we learned survival skills. Our brains are literally wired to find this stuff fascinating. It's the same reason kids can watch the same cartoon 847 times‚Äîrepetition plus slight variation equals dopamine jackpot.

**The bizarre economics:** A video of someone organizing their pantry can get 40 million views. A man building a pool using only primitive tools has 1.2 billion views. Someone cleaning a dirty carpet? 78 million views and counting. We're essentially paying people millions of dollars to let us watch them do chores we're actively avoiding.

**Peak humanity moment:** There's a YouTube channel with 3.8 million subscribers that just films machines making everyday objects in factories. No commentary. No music. Just the zen-like hum of automation. Their most popular video? "How Paperclips Are Made" with 127 million views.

## üéµ The Psychological Mystery of Earworms: Why Your Brain Is a Terrible DJ

*Cognitive Science Quarterly ‚Ä¢ September 2025*

"Baby shark, doo doo doo doo doo doo..." You're welcome. That song will now live rent-free in your head for the next 72 hours, because your brain is essentially a malfunctioning jukebox that only knows eight bars of the worst possible songs.

Scientists call them "involuntary musical imagery" or "stuck song syndrome," but we know them as earworms‚Äîthose musical parasites that burrow into your consciousness and set up a 24-hour disco. Research shows that 98% of people experience them, and the other 2% are probably lying or have achieved enlightenment.

The weird part? Earworms aren't random. They follow rules. Songs need to be simple but not TOO simple, familiar but not TOO familiar, and have what researchers call a "cognitive itch"‚Äîusually an unexpected leap or unresolved musical phrase that your brain desperately wants to complete. It's why "Call Me Maybe" conquered humanity's collective consciousness in 2012, but nobody's walking around humming Mahler's 9th Symphony.

**The cure is worse than the disease:** Traditional advice says to listen to the full song to "complete" the loop. Scientists tested this. It makes it WORSE. The only proven cure? Chewing gum. Seriously. The motor movement of your jaw interferes with your brain's ability to "hear" the music. British researchers discovered this, presumably after someone got "God Save the Queen" stuck on repeat and threatened national security.

**The evolutionary mystery:** Nobody knows why earworms exist. They serve no survival purpose. They don't make us better hunters or more attractive mates (quite the opposite if you're humming "Baby Shark" on a date). One theory: they're a glitch in our language-processing system, like your brain's screensaver got stuck.

**Most diabolical earworm ever created:** The "Nationwide is on your side" jingle has been scientifically proven to be the stickiest earworm in advertising history. Someone did a PhD on this. They measured brain activity. There are graphs.
