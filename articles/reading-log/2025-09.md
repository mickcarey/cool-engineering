### [The Perils of Using AI to Replace Entry-Level Jobs](https://hbr.org/2025/09/the-perils-of-using-ai-to-replace-entry-level-jobs)
*Harvard Business Review â€¢ Read: September 20, 2025*

This one hit different. While everyone's racing to automate everything that moves, HBR drops this truth bomb about why eliminating entry-level jobs is like burning your furniture to heat your houseâ€”sure, you're warm today, but what about tomorrow?

The article's core argument resonates: entry-level roles aren't just about getting coffee and making copies (do people still make copies?). They're where future leaders cut their teeth, where "aha!" moments happen at the intersection of mundane tasks and fresh perspectives.

**Personal reflection:** Makes me wonder if we're so obsessed with efficiency that we're forgetting effectiveness. The messiest, most human parts of workâ€”the confusion, the learning, the "wait, why do we do it this way?" momentsâ€”might be the most valuable.
