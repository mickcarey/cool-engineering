*The curiosities that caught my attention this month*

## Week 4

### [How Claude Code Is Built](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-claude-code-is-built)
*The Pragmatic Engineer â€¢ Read: September 25, 2025*

This is meta on so many levelsâ€”reading about how Claude Code works while using Claude Code to add the article to my curiosity cabinet! ðŸŽ­ The Pragmatic Engineer delivers an incredible behind-the-scenes look at how Anthropic built their coding assistant. It's not just about the AI; it's about the entire system architecture, the safety considerations, and the clever engineering decisions that make it all work.

What struck me most was the balance they've achieved between making Claude Code powerful enough to be genuinely useful (not just a fancy autocomplete) while keeping it safe and predictable. The tool use system, the context management, the careful boundariesâ€”it's like watching a high-wire act where every safety net has been thoughtfully placed.

**The revelation:** Building an AI coding assistant isn't just about training a model on code. It's about creating an entire ecosystem where AI and human developers can collaborate effectively. The real innovation isn't the AI itselfâ€”it's the interface between AI capabilities and human workflows.

## Week 3

### [Dev Culture Is Dying: The Curious Developer Is Gone](https://dayvster.com/blog/dev-culture-is-dying-the-curious-developer-is-gone/)
*Dayvi Schuster â€¢ Read: September 23, 2025*

Ouch. This one stings because it's true. Schuster basically wrote an obituary for the kind of developer who built things just to see if they could. Remember when people wrote code for fun? When side projects weren't "building in public for my personal brand"?

The article nails something I've been feeling but couldn't articulate: we've gone from "I wonder if I can make this work?" to "What's the TAM for this SaaS?" The tinkerer has been replaced by the optimizer. The hacker by the growth hacker.

**The bit that haunts me:** All the tools we worshipâ€”Linux, Git, VLCâ€”came from curious minds playing around, not from someone's OKRs. What revolutionary tools are we NOT building because everyone's too busy optimizing conversion funnels?

### [The Perils of Using AI to Replace Entry-Level Jobs](https://hbr.org/2025/09/the-perils-of-using-ai-to-replace-entry-level-jobs)
*Harvard Business Review â€¢ Read: September 20, 2025*

This one hit different. While everyone's racing to automate everything that moves, HBR drops this truth bomb about why eliminating entry-level jobs is like burning your furniture to heat your houseâ€”sure, you're warm today, but what about tomorrow?

The article's core argument resonates: entry-level roles aren't just about getting coffee and making copies (do people still make copies?). They're where future leaders cut their teeth, where "aha!" moments happen at the intersection of mundane tasks and fresh perspectives.

**Personal reflection:** Makes me wonder if we're so obsessed with efficiency that we're forgetting effectiveness. The messiest, most human parts of workâ€”the confusion, the learning, the "wait, why do we do it this way?" momentsâ€”might be the most valuable.
