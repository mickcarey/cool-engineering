*The curiosities that caught my attention this month*

## Week 3

### [Dev Culture Is Dying: The Curious Developer Is Gone](https://dayvster.com/blog/dev-culture-is-dying-the-curious-developer-is-gone/)
*Dayvi Schuster â€¢ Read: September 23, 2025*

Ouch. This one stings because it's true. Schuster basically wrote an obituary for the kind of developer who built things just to see if they could. Remember when people wrote code for fun? When side projects weren't "building in public for my personal brand"?

The article nails something I've been feeling but couldn't articulate: we've gone from "I wonder if I can make this work?" to "What's the TAM for this SaaS?" The tinkerer has been replaced by the optimizer. The hacker by the growth hacker.

**The bit that haunts me:** All the tools we worshipâ€”Linux, Git, VLCâ€”came from curious minds playing around, not from someone's OKRs. What revolutionary tools are we NOT building because everyone's too busy optimizing conversion funnels?

### [The Perils of Using AI to Replace Entry-Level Jobs](https://hbr.org/2025/09/the-perils-of-using-ai-to-replace-entry-level-jobs)
*Harvard Business Review â€¢ Read: September 20, 2025*

This one hit different. While everyone's racing to automate everything that moves, HBR drops this truth bomb about why eliminating entry-level jobs is like burning your furniture to heat your houseâ€”sure, you're warm today, but what about tomorrow?

The article's core argument resonates: entry-level roles aren't just about getting coffee and making copies (do people still make copies?). They're where future leaders cut their teeth, where "aha!" moments happen at the intersection of mundane tasks and fresh perspectives.

**Personal reflection:** Makes me wonder if we're so obsessed with efficiency that we're forgetting effectiveness. The messiest, most human parts of workâ€”the confusion, the learning, the "wait, why do we do it this way?" momentsâ€”might be the most valuable.
