A fascinating deep-dive into the engineering behind Claude Codeâ€”Anthropic's AI coding assistant. This behind-the-scenes look reveals the architectural decisions, technical challenges, and innovative approaches that went into building a tool that can actually write and modify code. It's like getting a backstage pass to one of the most interesting engineering projects in AI right now.

**The wow moment:** The intricate dance between safety, capability, and usability that shapes every architectural decision. It's not just about making an AI that can codeâ€”it's about making one that codes responsibly.

### [The Perils of Using AI to Replace Entry-Level Jobs](https://hbr.org/2025/09/the-perils-of-using-ai-to-replace-entry-level-jobs)
*Harvard Business Review â€¢ September 2025*

Why the rush to automate away entry-level positions might be Silicon Valley's biggest own-goal yet. This piece makes a compelling case that entry-level jobs aren't just busyworkâ€”they're innovation incubators and leadership laboratories. The article warns that companies eliminating these roles are essentially eating their seed corn.

**The paradox:** AI can handle 50-60% of junior tasks, but the remaining 40-50% is where all the magic happensâ€”the messy, human bits where judgment meets creativity.

**Favorite quote:** Work should remain "a site of growth, resilience, and shared human achievement" rather than just an optimization problem to be solved.
