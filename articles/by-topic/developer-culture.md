### [Dev Culture Is Dying: The Curious Developer Is Gone](https://dayvster.com/blog/dev-culture-is-dying-the-curious-developer-is-gone/)
*Dayvi Schuster â€¢ September 18, 2025*

A passionate lament for the death of the tinkerer's mindset in modern development. Schuster argues we've traded curiosity for metrics, replacing the builders of Linux and Git with optimizers of MRR and DAU. The shift from "what can I create?" to "what can I monetize?" might be killing the very spirit that made software magical in the first place.

**The diagnosis:** Modern devs identify as "React developers" or "Next.js developers" rather than problem-solvers. We've become tool-operators rather than tool-creators.

**The prescription:** Build what you can't ship. Create for the joy of creation. Learn without a business case.

**Most provocative point:** The tools that revolutionized development (Linux, Git, VLC) came from curious tinkerers, not metric-optimizers. What happens when that curiosity dies?
