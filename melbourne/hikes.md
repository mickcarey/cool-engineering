## 🌊 The Coastal Wonders

### Point Nepean National Park
📍 **Distance from Keilor Downs:** ~95km (1hr 20min drive)
🚶 **Walk Length:** 6.5km loop (Fort Nepean Circuit)
⏱️ **Time:** 2-3 hours

The tip of the Mornington Peninsula where Port Phillip Bay meets Bass Strait! This walk takes you through historic military fortifications, pristine beaches, and some seriously dramatic coastal scenery. On a clear day, you can see across to Queenscliff. The ocean here has *personality* - sometimes serene, sometimes moody, always photogenic.

**Why it's ace:** Historic forts + wild ocean views + the thrill of standing where two bodies of water collide

### Great Ocean Road - Lorne to Teddy's Lookout
📍 **Distance from Keilor Downs:** ~150km (2hr drive)
🚶 **Walk Length:** 6km return
⏱️ **Time:** 2-2.5 hours

This one's a cardio workout disguised as a scenic walk! You'll climb through eucalyptus forest with increasingly spectacular views of Loutit Bay and the coastline. Teddy's Lookout at the top rewards your effort with 180-degree ocean panoramas. Pro tip: Time it for late afternoon when the light goes golden.

**Why it's ace:** The ocean reveals itself gradually as you climb - very satisfying dramatic reveal vibes

## 💧 The Waterfall Hunters

### Steavenson Falls - Marysville
📍 **Distance from Keilor Downs:** ~125km (1hr 40min drive)
🚶 **Walk Length:** 600m circuit (to viewing platform)
⏱️ **Time:** 20-30 minutes

Short but mighty! Victoria's tallest single-span waterfall (84 meters) is a quick stroll from the car park through lush fern gullies. After recent rain, this thing is an absolute unit. The viewing platforms let you get up close to the cascading action, and the negative ions are basically nature's antidepressants.

**Why it's ace:** Big waterfall energy with minimal effort - perfect for when you want maximum reward with reasonable exertion

---

### Hopetoun Falls
📍 **Distance from Keilor Downs:** ~180km (2hr 30min drive via Otways)
🚶 **Walk Length:** 1.2km return
⏱️ **Time:** 30-40 minutes

Hidden in the Otways rainforest, this twin waterfall is straight out of a fantasy novel. The walk takes you through ancient forest with tree ferns that make you feel like you've shrunk. The falls themselves drop into a natural amphitheater - it's genuinely enchanting. Bring your camera, because this one's unreal.

**Why it's ace:** Rainforest magic + double waterfalls = pure fairytale vibes

---

## 🏔️ The Summit Seekers

### Mount Macedon Memorial Cross
📍 **Distance from Keilor Downs:** ~55km (50min drive)
🚶 **Walk Length:** 2.6km return
⏱️ **Time:** 1-1.5 hours

A local classic! This walk takes you through cool temperate forest to a memorial cross at the summit (1,013m). On a clear day, you'll see Melbourne's skyline, Port Phillip Bay, and even the You Yangs. Autumn is particularly stunning here when the exotic trees go full technicolor.

**Why it's ace:** Close to home + spectacular 360° views + autumn colour show

---

### The Pinnacle - Grampians National Park
📍 **Distance from Keilor Downs:** ~270km (3hr drive)
🚶 **Walk Length:** 4.4km return
⏱️ **Time:** 2-3 hours

Okay, this one's a bit of a trek to get there, but WOW. The Pinnacle walk takes you to a dramatic rocky lookout jutting out over the valley. The final section involves some rock hopping and scrambling (nothing too gnarly), but when you reach the end, you're literally standing on a precipice with nothing between you and the vast expanse below. It's genuinely jaw-dropping.

**Why it's ace:** That "king of the world" feeling when you're standing on the edge of forever

---

### Mount Donna Buang Summit
📍 **Distance from Keilor Downs:** ~115km (1hr 30min drive)
🚶 **Walk Length:** 1.5km loop (from car park to viewing tower)
⏱️ **Time:** 30-45 minutes

Drive to the top, walk the final bit! This one's got a 21-meter tall viewing tower that pokes above the treeline. The views stretch across the Yarra Ranges and on clear days, you can see all the way to the city. In winter, this place sometimes gets snow, which is pretty magical. The walk through the mountain ash forest is beautiful year-round.

**Why it's ace:** Easy access + viewing tower for those aerial shots + potential snow vibes

---

## 🌳 The Forest Ramblers

### Dandenong Ranges - 1000 Steps Kokoda Track Memorial Walk
📍 **Distance from Keilor Downs:** ~60km (1hr drive)
🚶 **Walk Length:** 3.2km return
⏱️ **Time:** 1-1.5 hours

The Melbourne fitness test! Despite the name, there are actually only about 770 steps, but who's counting when your quads are screaming? This walk through towering mountain ash forest is a memorial to the Australian soldiers who fought on the Kokoda Trail. It's steep, it's challenging, and it's incredibly popular for good reason - the forest is gorgeous and you'll feel accomplished at the top.

**Why it's ace:** Proper workout + beautiful tall forest + sense of achievement when you're done

---

### Sherbrooke Falls
📍 **Distance from Keilor Downs:** ~65km (1hr 10min drive)
🚶 **Walk Length:** 2.4km loop
⏱️ **Time:** 45min-1 hour

An easier Dandenongs option! This peaceful loop takes you through fern gullies to a lovely little waterfall. You'll probably hear the distinctive call of lyrebirds (they're excellent mimics - sometimes hilariously so). The creek follows you for much of the walk, and the whole thing feels very zen and restorative.

**Why it's ace:** Gentler pace + lyrebirds doing their thing + fern gully serenity

## Final Thoughts

These walks are all doable as day trips from Keilor Downs, though some of the longer drives might warrant an early start or even an overnight stay. The beauty of Melbourne's position is that you can be in mountains, forests, or coastal landscapes within a couple of hours. So grab your boots, pack some Tim Tams for summit snacks, and get out there!

*Remember: Take only photos, leave only footprints, and maybe do a few squats to prepare for the 1000 Steps if it's your first time.* 😅
