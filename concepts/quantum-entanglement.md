# Quantum Entanglement: The Spooky Action at Distance 👻

## Introduction of This Very Confuse Topic

Hello my friend! Today I will explain you about quantum entanglement. This is very difficult science topic but I try my best to make you understand even my English is not so much good. Please forgive me if I saying wrong words.

## What is Quantum Entanglement Anyway?

Okay so quantum entanglement is when two particle become like... how to say... like best friend forever? 😄 But more than best friend. They become SO CLOSE that even if you separate them to very very far distance (like one particle go to Beijing and other particle go to New York), they still know what each other is doing!

Einstein called this "spooky action at distance" because even HIM think it was too weird and maybe impossible. But guess what? He was wrong! Nature is more strange than Einstein brain can imagine. Sorry Einstein! 🤷

## How Does This Magic Happen?

So imagine you have two coin. Normal coin, you flip it, you get head or tail, very simple. But quantum coin is not normal coin (because physics scientist always make thing complicated for no reason 😤).

In quantum world, before you looking at the coin, it is BOTH head and tail at same time! This called "superposition" which is fancy word meaning "the coin is confuse about its life".

Now here come the crazy part:

When you make two quantum particle become entangle (maybe they fall in love? 💕), they promise to each other: "Whatever you are, I will be opposite" or "Whatever you are, I will be same" - depend on what kind of entanglement they have.

So when you finally look at first particle and it say "Hi I am head!", the other particle IMMEDIATELY know it must become tail (or head, depend on their agreement). And this happen INSTANT! Faster than light! Faster than my grandmother running to supermarket when they have sale on vegetable!

## Why This Make Scientist Head Explode 🤯

Problem is: How second particle know what first particle is doing? They very far away! There is no telephone wire connect them! No WeChat message! No quantum WhatsApp! Nothing!

It just... know. Like magic. But is not magic, is physics. Even though look exactly same as magic.

Some scientist say "Ahh maybe there is hidden variable we not see yet!" But then Bell's Theorem come and say "No no no, I do experiment, there is no hidden variable, this really is THAT weird." So now everybody just accept is weird.

## What Can We Use This For?

You might thinking "Okay this is cool party trick, but what I can do with entangle particle?" Well let me tell you!

### Quantum Computer 💻
Scientist trying to build quantum computer using entanglement. Regular computer use 0 and 1. Quantum computer use 0, 1, and "yes I am both until you check me please stop asking". This make calculation very very fast! Theoretically. In practice, quantum computer mostly just break and scientist cry.

### Quantum Teleportation 🚀
Sound like Star Trek! But sorry, cannot teleport human. Can only teleport information about quantum state. Still cool though! Maybe in future we can teleport my homework to teacher without need to walk to school (I am dreaming 😴).

### Super Secure Communication 🔐
If Alice want send secret message to Bob (these two people always in physics example, I don't know why), they can use entangle particle! If evil Eve try to spy on message, the entanglement will break and Alice and Bob will know someone is watching. Is like alarm system but for physics!

## Some Mind Blow Fact 🌟

- Entanglement work no matter how far apart particle is! Could be different galaxy! Universe don't care!
- Cannot use entanglement to send message faster than light (many people try to clever loophole this, but universe say NO)
- Once you measure particle, the entanglement break. Poof! Gone! Like my motivation on Monday morning.
- Some scientist think EVERYTHING in universe might be entangle with everything else. We all connected, man. Very philosophical. 🧘

## Conclusion (Finally!)

Quantum entanglement is proof that universe is more weird than we can think. Two particle can be connect in way that nothing in our normal experience can explain. Einstein not like it. Schrödinger not like it. But nature don't care what physicist like or not like!

This is beauty of science: Universe follow own rule, not our rule. And our job is just try to understand even when our brain want to cry. 😅

Thank you for reading my explain! I hope you now understand quantum entanglement at least little bit. If not understand, is okay - most professional physicist also not fully understand, they just better at pretend they understand!

Remember: In quantum world, nothing is real until you look at it. Maybe this article also not real until you read it? Who know! 🤷‍♂️

## Reference (Make Me Look Professional)

- Einstein, who think this is impossible (sorry Einstein!)
- Schrödinger, who make famous cat (poor cat 🐱)
- Bell, who prove is really that weird
- My physics teacher, who try very hard to teach me but I still confuse
