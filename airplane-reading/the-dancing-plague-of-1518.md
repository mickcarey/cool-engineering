# The Dancing Plague of 1518 üíÉ

## When an Entire Town Couldn't Stop Dancing (and It Killed Them)

In July 1518, in the city of Strasbourg (then part of the Holy Roman Empire, now France), a woman named Frau Troffea walked into the street and began to dance. She danced for hours. Then days. Then weeks. And she couldn't stop.

Within a month, around 400 people had joined her‚Äîdancing uncontrollably, day and night, until dozens of them literally danced themselves to death from exhaustion, heart attacks, and strokes.

This actually happened. We have historical records. And we still don't know why.

## How It Started üé≠

### July 14, 1518 - Day One

Frau Troffea (also written as "Troffea" or "Trompin") stepped into the narrow street in Strasbourg and began dancing. Not casually‚Äî*feverishly*.

**No music.**
**No celebration.**
**Just dancing.**

Her husband begged her to stop. She couldn't. Or wouldn't. She danced through the day, into the night, and through the next day.

### Week One: The Spread Begins

Within a week, 34 others had joined her. They danced in the streets, in their homes, wherever they were when the compulsion struck.

Contemporary accounts describe:
- Wild, uncontrolled movements
- Expressions of distress and fear
- Pleading to stop but being unable to
- Dancing until collapse, then resuming after brief rest

### Week Three: Full Outbreak

By early August, around 400 people were dancing. The authorities were panicking. People were dying.

Causes of death:
- Heart attacks
- Strokes
- Exhaustion
- Dehydration

Historical physician notes describe "hot blood" and people dancing "as if possessed."

## The Medical Response (Oh No) üè•

Medieval doctors examined the dancers and came to a conclusion:

**"They have hot blood. The cure is... MORE DANCING."**

I wish I were joking.

### The City's Solution: Encourage It

The Strasbourg authorities decided the cure for uncontrollable dancing was:
- Hire musicians to play continuously
- Build wooden stages
- Provide professional dancers to accompany them
- Let them "dance it out"

**The logic:** The dancing is caused by overheated blood. Dancing will cool it down. (Medieval medicine, everyone!)

**The result:** It got worse. WAY worse. More people joined. More people died.

### Realization and Reversal

After about two weeks of state-sponsored dancing, authorities realized: "Wait, this is making it worse."

They reversed course:
- Banned public dancing entirely
- Removed the stages
- Banished the musicians
- Carried dancers to nearby shrines for prayer

## The Theories: What Caused This? ü§î

Over 500 years later, we're still not sure. Here are the main theories:

### Theory 1: Ergot Poisoning (The Fungus Theory) üçÑ

**What is ergot?**
- A fungus that grows on rye and wheat
- Contains compounds similar to LSD
- Causes convulsions, hallucinations, and muscle spasms
- Known to cause "St. Anthony's Fire" (gangrenous ergotism)

**Evidence for:**
- The region had experienced bad weather (ideal for ergot)
- Ergot causes involuntary movements
- Medieval Europe had multiple ergot outbreaks

**Evidence against:**
- Ergot causes painful muscle contractions, not rhythmic dancing
- Victims usually have gangrene and hallucinations
- Dancing was coordinated, not spasmodic
- It spread in a pattern suggesting social contagion, not food poisoning
- No records of other ergot symptoms (burning sensations, hallucinations)

**Verdict:** Probably not ergot.

### Theory 2: Mass Psychogenic Illness (The Hysteria Theory) üß†

**What is it?**
- Also called "mass hysteria"
- A psychological phenomenon where illness spreads through a group via psychological means
- Triggered by stress, anxiety, or fear
- Symptoms are real but have no organic cause

**Evidence for:**
- Strasbourg in 1518 was a MESS:
  - Famine from failed harvests
  - Deadly disease outbreaks (smallpox, syphilis)
  - Extreme poverty
  - Religious fervor and fear of divine punishment
  - Social instability

- The dancing fits the pattern of mass psychogenic illness:
  - Started with one person
  - Spread through visual exposure
  - Affected stressed, vulnerable populations
  - Stopped when social conditions changed

- Historical precedent: Other "dancing manias" occurred in medieval Europe

**Evidence against:**
- How do you psychologically induce *weeks* of continuous dancing?
- Multiple people died‚Äîthat's extreme for psychogenic illness
- Dancers reported being unable to stop, not choosing to dance

**Verdict:** Most historians favor this theory.

### Theory 3: Religious Ecstasy or Curse (The Supernatural Theory) üôè

**Medieval Belief:**
- People thought it was a curse from St. Vitus
- St. Vitus was associated with dancing sickness
- The "cure" was pilgrimage to St. Vitus shrines

**Why people believed it:**
- 1518 Strasbourg was deeply religious
- Unexplained illnesses = divine punishment
- Dancing plagues were associated with saints' curses
- The outbreak stopped after religious intervention

**Modern assessment:**
- Not supernatural, but the *belief* in curses may have contributed
- Stress from religious fear could trigger psychogenic response
- Pilgrimage = removal from the stressful environment = recovery

**Verdict:** The *belief* in curses likely played a role, but it wasn't actually supernatural.

### Theory 4: Cult Activity or Mass Ritual (The Conspiracy Theory) üé™

**The idea:**
- Maybe it was a secret dance cult
- Or a form of protest
- Or a weird religious sect

**Evidence for:**
- Medieval Europe had heretical dance sects
- Some groups practiced ecstatic dancing
- Dancing could be a form of rebellion

**Evidence against:**
- Contemporary accounts describe distress, not ecstasy
- Dancers begged to stop
- People died‚Äîcult members wouldn't kill themselves
- No records of a cult in Strasbourg

**Verdict:** Unlikely.

## The Historical Context: Why Strasbourg? üìú

To understand why this happened, you need to understand how bad things were in 1518 Strasbourg:

### The Perfect Storm of Misery

**Famine:**
- Catastrophic harvests in 1500s
- Bread prices skyrocketed
- People were starving

**Disease:**
- Smallpox outbreak
- Syphilis epidemic
- Leprosy
- Plague still lingering from previous centuries

**Poverty:**
- Economic collapse
- Mass unemployment
- Homelessness

**Religious Anxiety:**
- Fear of divine punishment
- Belief in demonic possession
- Apocalyptic preaching

**Social Breakdown:**
- Crime rates soaring
- Class tensions
- Political instability

People were stressed beyond belief. They were primed for a mass psychological event.

### The St. Vitus Connection

Medieval Europe had a long history of "dancing plagues":
- 1021 - K√∂lbigk, Germany
- 1237 - Erfurt, Germany (200+ children danced out of town)
- 1278 - Utrecht, Netherlands (200 people danced on a bridge until it collapsed)
- 1374 - Aachen, Germany (largest outbreak before 1518)
- 1518 - Strasbourg (the most documented)

All were attributed to St. Vitus (patron saint of dancers and epileptics). The belief: if you displeased St. Vitus, he'd curse you with uncontrollable dancing.

## What the Primary Sources Say üìñ

We have multiple contemporary accounts:

### The Strasbourg Chronicle

> "Many people, both men and women, began to dance day and night, without pause, until they collapsed."

### Physician's Notes

> "The sickness is caused by hot blood and overheated humors. The cure is to allow them to dance until exhaustion cools the blood."

(Spoiler: This did not work.)

### Sebastian Brant (Chronicler)

> "For weeks they danced... Many died of exhaustion. The plague finally ended when they were taken to the shrine of St. Vitus."

### Paracelsus (The Famous Physician)

Years later, Paracelsus (who lived in the region) wrote about the event:

> "They danced not from desire, but from compulsion, as if driven by an external force."

He rejected the "hot blood" theory and suggested psychological causes.

## The Modern Medical Take ü©∫

### John Waller (Historian, 2008)

In his book "A Time to Dance, A Time to Die," historian John Waller argues:

**The dancing plague was stress-induced psychogenic illness:**
- Extreme stress triggers psychological symptoms
- In a culture that believed in dancing curses, that's how the stress manifested
- It spread through social contagion
- When the stressful environment was removed (pilgrimage), it stopped

### Why Dancing Specifically?

In medieval culture:
- Dancing was associated with sin, possession, and divine punishment
- People feared being cursed with uncontrollable dancing
- That cultural belief shaped how stress manifested

**Modern parallel:** "Hysteria" in Victorian England manifested as fainting and "vapors" because that's what the culture expected. Stress manifests in culturally-shaped ways.

## Other Dancing Plagues üåç

Strasbourg 1518 wasn't alone:

### The Dancing Mania of 1374

- Started in Aachen, Germany
- Spread to other cities
- Hundreds danced through streets
- Lasted months
- Attributed to St. Vitus and St. John

### Tanganyika Laughter Epidemic (1962)

Not dancing, but related:
- Tanzania (then Tanganyika)
- Started with three girls laughing uncontrollably
- Spread to 1,000 people across multiple villages
- Lasted 18 months
- Schools closed
- Classic mass psychogenic illness

### The Pok√©mon Seizure Incident (1997)

Modern example:
- Japan, December 16, 1997
- A Pok√©mon episode aired with flashing lights
- 685 viewers reported seizures
- Most didn't actually have seizures‚Äîthey saw the news coverage and psychologically induced symptoms
- Mass psychogenic illness in the modern era

## The Lessons üéì

The Dancing Plague of 1518 teaches us:

### 1. The Mind-Body Connection Is Powerful

Stress, fear, and cultural beliefs can create *real* physical symptoms. The dancers weren't faking‚Äîthey genuinely couldn't stop.

### 2. Social Contagion Is Real

Behaviors and symptoms can spread through observation, especially in stressed populations.

### 3. Cultural Context Matters

In 1518, stress manifested as dancing because of cultural beliefs about St. Vitus. Today, it might manifest differently (chronic fatigue, seizures, fainting).

### 4. We're Not Immune

Modern examples (Tanganyika, Pok√©mon incident) show mass psychogenic illness still happens. Humans are social creatures‚Äîwe're wired to mirror each other.

### 5. Bad Medical Advice Can Make Things Worse

The "cure more dancing with more dancing" approach made everything worse. Sometimes doing nothing is better than doing the wrong thing.

## The Strangest Details üé™

- **No records of music:** Most accounts don't mention music at all. They just... danced.

- **Dancers were transported:** Authorities physically carried dancers to St. Vitus shrines. The journey took days.

- **Some recovered, some didn't:** Not everyone who danced died, but many never fully recovered.

- **It ended suddenly:** Once dancers were removed from Strasbourg and taken to shrines, the outbreak stopped within weeks.

- **No children:** The outbreak primarily affected adults, unlike earlier dancing manias that affected children.

## The Unresolved Mystery üîç

Despite centuries of study, we don't definitively know:

- Why it started with Frau Troffea
- Why dancing specifically
- Why it lasted so long
- Why it stopped when it did
- Whether some other factor (toxin, disease, cult) played a role

## Why It Still Fascinates Us üåü

The Dancing Plague of 1518 captivates because:

1. **It's well-documented:** We have primary sources, physician notes, and city records
2. **It's bizarre:** People danced themselves to death‚Äîthat's nightmare fuel
3. **It's unsolved:** We still debate the cause
4. **It's human:** It shows how fragile our minds can be under stress
5. **It's a warning:** Extreme societal stress can cause mass psychological breaks

## The Ultimate Question üí≠

Could it happen today?

**Yes. Kind of. It already does.**

Modern "mass psychogenic illnesses" include:
- Social media-induced tic outbreaks (TikTok Tourette's trend)
- Mysterious seizure clusters in schools
- "Havana Syndrome" (possibly)
- Mass fainting at concerts

We're not immune to social contagion. We're just as vulnerable to stress-induced symptoms as medieval peasants were.

The only difference? We don't blame St. Vitus anymore.

*The Dancing Plague of 1518 is a reminder that humans are weird, stress is dangerous, and sometimes history is stranger than any fiction writer would dare imagine. Four hundred people danced until they collapsed, and we're still not entirely sure why. That's both terrifying and fascinating in equal measure.* üíÉ‚ú®

*May you never be compelled to dance against your will. Unless it's a really good song.* üéµ
