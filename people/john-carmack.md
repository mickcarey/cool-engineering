# John Carmack 🚀
*The Rocket Scientist Who Conquered 3D Gaming*

## The Programming Prodigy from Kansas

John D. Carmack II (born August 20, 1970) isn't just a game developer – he's the mathematical wizard who literally invented modern 3D gaming, then got bored and decided to build rockets and VR headsets. No big deal! 🎮

## The id Software Era: Doom, Quake, and Digital Demons 👹

At id Software, Carmack didn't just make games; he invented entire genres:

### The Revolution Timeline:
- **Commander Keen** (1990): Smooth scrolling on PC? Impossible! Carmack: "Hold my Diet Coke"
- **Wolfenstein 3D** (1992): Invented the first-person shooter
- **DOOM** (1993): Created multiplayer deathmatch and modding culture
- **Quake** (1996): True 3D gaming with mouselook and internet multiplayer

He basically went from "PCs can't do smooth scrolling" to "here's a fully 3D networked game engine" in six years. Show-off! 🎯

## The Carmack Engineering Philosophy 🛠️

**"The Carmack Method":**
1. See impossible problem
2. Lock yourself in a room with Diet Coke
3. Emerge days later with revolutionary solution
4. Release source code because sharing is caring
5. Already be working on the next impossible thing

## Legendary Algorithms & Hacks 🧮

- **Carmack's Reverse**: Shadow volume rendering algorithm (still used today!)
- **Surface Caching**: Made Quake possible on 1996 hardware
- **Fast Inverse Square Root**: That mysterious 0x5f3759df magic number
- **Binary Space Partitioning**: Solved real-time 3D rendering in DOOM
- **Adaptive Tile Refresh**: Made smooth side-scrolling possible on PC

The man optimized code like a surgeon with OCD and a PhD in mathematics!

## The Rocket Years at Armadillo Aerospace 🚀

"Video games are getting boring. Let's build actual rockets!"
- Founded Armadillo Aerospace in 2000
- Spent millions of his own money
- Built functional rockets in his garage
- Won NASA prize competitions
- Eventually sold tech to other space companies

Because apparently revolutionizing one industry wasn't enough!

## The VR Prophet: Oculus and Beyond 🥽

2013: Joins Oculus as CTO
- Fixed fundamental VR problems everyone said were unsolvable
- Pioneered "time warping" to reduce motion sickness
- Made VR actually work on normal hardware
- Then moved to Meta's AGI research because VR got too easy

## Carmack's Quirks & Legends 🎪

- **The Ferrari Incident**: Won John Romero's Ferrari in a Quake deathmatch
- **The .plan Files**: Published daily development thoughts before blogs existed
- **Code Reviews From Hell**: Would rewrite entire codebases if they offended him
- **Jiu-Jitsu Black Belt**: Because debugging humans is similar to debugging code
- **The Office Cave**: Worked in complete darkness with just monitor glow

## Epic Quotes from the Master 💬

- "Focused, hard work is the real key to success."
- "If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don't need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it."
- "Programming is not a zero-sum game. Teaching something to a fellow programmer doesn't take it away from you."
- "Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function. Not a method. Not a class. Not a framework. Just a function."

## The Open Source Legend 📖

Carmack didn't just create revolutionary engines – he gave them away:
- Released DOOM source code in 1997
- Released Quake source code in 1999
- Inspired entire generation of game developers
- Launched a thousand game development careers
- Proved open source could drive innovation

## Carmack's Current Quest: AGI 🤖

Left Meta in 2022 to start Keen Technologies:
- Working on Artificial General Intelligence
- Because "it's the most important problem"
- Approaches AGI like a game engine optimization problem
- Probably coding in a dark room right now

## The Carmack Development Setup 🖥️

- Multiple monitors (more pixels = more productivity)
- Ergonomic keyboard (RSI is the real boss battle)
- Vanilla text editors (IDEs are for mortals)
- Direct hardware access (abstractions are for the weak)
- Diet Coke IV drip (unconfirmed but probable)

## Fun Facts 🎮

- Taught himself programming from library books
- Got arrested as a teenager for stealing Apple IIe computers (to make games!)
- Can recite vast amounts of code from memory
- Still writes code daily, even as a executive
- Types at superhuman speeds while maintaining eye contact

## The Carmack Legacy ✨

Every time you:
- Play any FPS game
- Experience smooth 3D graphics
- Mod a game
- Use VR without vomiting
- See real-time shadows in games

...you're experiencing Carmack's influence!

## Life Philosophy 🧠

"In the information age, the barriers just aren't there. The barriers are self-imposed. If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don't need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it. We slept on floors. We waded across rivers."
