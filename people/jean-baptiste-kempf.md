# Jean-Baptiste Kempf üé¨

## The Open Source Maverick Who Said No to Billions

Jean-Baptiste Kempf is the president of VideoLAN and the lead developer of VLC media player - that orange traffic cone icon that's saved millions of us from codec hell. What makes him truly fascinating isn't just that he helped build the world's most popular open-source media player, but that he's repeatedly turned down acquisition offers worth tens of millions (some say billions) of dollars to keep VLC free and ad-free.

## The Philosophy of "Just Works" üöÄ

Kempf embodies a refreshingly pure approach to software: make something that works for everyone, everywhere, without strings attached. Under his leadership, VLC has:
- Never shown a single ad
- Never collected user data
- Never required registration
- Played virtually every media format known to humanity

## The Stubborn Idealist üí°

What's captivating about Kempf is his absolute refusal to compromise on principles. When offered massive buyouts, his response has consistently been: "Money is not my goal. I have a salary, I can eat every day and I can sleep under a roof. That's enough for me."

In an era of surveillance capitalism and enshittification, he's like a digital monk - choosing purpose over profit.

## Fun Facts & Quirks üé≠

- Started contributing to VLC as a student at √âcole Centrale Paris
- Runs VideoLAN as a non-profit from France
- Has given talks wearing VLC-themed t-shirts with pride
- Believes deeply that culture (movies, music, videos) should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic situation
- Once said "If you want to help VLC, just use it and be happy"

## The Accidental Revolutionary üè¥

Perhaps without intending to, Kempf has become a symbol of resistance against the modern tech industry's worst impulses. VLC stands as proof that software can be:
- Universally useful
- Completely free
- Respectful of privacy
- Sustainable without venture capital

In a world of subscription models and data harvesting, Jean-Baptiste Kempf is the hero we didn't know we needed - armed with nothing but a traffic cone and an unshakeable belief that software should serve people, not profits.

## Legacy üåü

Every time someone double-clicks that orange cone to watch a movie without worrying about formats, codecs, or privacy invasions, they're experiencing Kempf's vision of what technology should be: invisible, helpful, and human-centered.

*"I am not a billionaire, but I am proud of what we've built."* - A philosophy worth more than any acquisition offer.
