**Origin:** Churchville, Pennsylvania
**Genre:** Pop punk, emo pop, alternative rock

## The Yearbook Band 📸

The Starting Line is what would happen if your high school yearbook committee started a pop punk band and somehow got really, really good at it. They captured teenage life with such accuracy that listening to them as an adult feels like reading your old diary (equally nostalgic and mortifying).

## Delightfully Specific Tidbits 🎭

### The Age Problem 👶
When they signed to Drive-Thru Records, guitarist Matt Watts was only 14 years old. He had to get permission slips signed to go on tour. Imagine needing your mom's signature to play Warped Tour!

### The Best of Me Conspiracy 🎵
"Best of Me" was written in 20 minutes and almost didn't make it onto *Say It Like You Mean It*. It became their biggest song and still gets played at every wedding where at least one person had an emo phase.

### The Ken Vasoli Evolution 🎤
Lead singer Ken Vasoli was 15 when they recorded their first album. His voice literally changed during their career – you can track puberty through their discography. He later formed Person L and became a legitimate soul singer because apparently one genre wasn't enough.

### The Island Recording Mystery 🏝️
They recorded *Direction* on a literal island with producer Howard Benson. No one could leave until the album was done. It was either genius or Stockholm syndrome. The album sounds like both.

### The Honda Civic Tour Victory 🚗
They were one of the first "small" bands to headline the Honda Civic Tour in 2003, beating out much bigger acts. Honda executives reportedly chose them because "they reminded us of our target demographic's older brothers." Marketing!

## Why They Hit Different 🎯

The Starting Line occupied a sweet spot between pop punk energy and emo introspection. They wrote songs about specific moments – the last day of school, summer jobs, awkward parties – with such detail that everyone swore they were writing about their hometown.

They also had this uncanny ability to make sadness sound hopeful. Even their breakup songs felt like beginnings rather than endings.

## The Geffen Records Situation 💔
Their major label album *Direction* was supposed to be their big break. Geffen barely promoted it, then dropped them. The band called it "the best worst thing" that happened to them. They returned to Vagrant Records and made *Somebody's Gonna Miss Us*, their most honest work.

## Essential Nostalgia Bombs 💣
- "Best of Me"
- "Island"
- "Bedroom Talk"
- "Three's a Charm"
- "Up & Go"
- "Photographs"

## The Spelling Bee Champions 🏆
Three of the five members were legitimately accomplished spelling bee competitors in elementary school. This explains nothing and everything about their meticulous lyrics.

## The Night Owl Sessions 🦉
They recorded most of *Say It Like You Mean It* between 11 PM and 7 AM because studio time was cheaper. The exhaustion added to the raw emotion. Or they were just really tired. Both work.

## The Reunion Rules 📋
When they reunite for shows (which they do sporadically), they have three rules:
1. Play the hits (they're not too cool for nostalgia)
2. No new material (everyone's there for 2002)
3. Ken must attempt the high note in "Leaving" (success rate: 60%)

## The Musical Theater Connection 🎭
Guitarist Mike Golla went on to compose music for theater productions. From pop punk to Broadway is a journey nobody saw coming, but somehow it makes perfect sense.

## The Warped Tour Record 📊
They played Warped Tour more times than they can remember, but their proudest achievement: Never missing a single show due to hangover. Professional!

## The Time Capsule Effect ⏰
Listening to The Starting Line doesn't just remind you of being young – it makes you feel like you're actually there, in your best friend's basement, believing that these feelings were the most important things that would ever happen to you. And maybe they were.

## The Secret Influence 🤫
Multiple modern pop punk bands cite The Starting Line as influences but specifically *not* their hits. Deep cuts like "Decisions, Decisions" and "Surprise, Surprise" became blueprints for the 2010s pop punk revival.

## Still Starting 🚀
They never officially broke up, just... stopped. And occasionally start again. It's very on-brand for a band named The Starting Line to never quite finish.
