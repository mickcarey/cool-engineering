# New Found Glory 🌟🎪

**Active:** 1997-present
**Origin:** Coral Springs, Florida
**Genre:** Pop punk, alternative rock, emo pop

## The Pop Punk Lifers 🎸

New Found Glory is the golden retriever of pop punk bands – impossibly energetic, endlessly enthusiastic, and somehow still jumping around like teenagers despite being in their 40s. They didn't invent pop punk, but they perfected the formula and then refused to stop making it.

## Magnificently Random Facts 🎊

### The Name Game 🎮
They were originally called "A New Found Glory" after watching *The Empire Strikes Back*. They dropped the "A" because, according to Jordan Pundik, "It sounded stupid when people said it out loud." Marketing genius!

### The International Superheroes 🦸‍♂️
In Japan, they're literally bigger than The Beatles (okay, not literally, but they've sold out arenas there while playing clubs in the US). Japanese fans call them "NFG-sama" and bow after songs. The band finds this equally awesome and bewildering.

### The Warped Tour Record Holders 🏆
NFG has played Warped Tour more than any other band in history (eight times as main stage headliners). Kevin Lyman once said, "They're basically part of the infrastructure at this point."

### The Hayley Williams Discovery 💡
NFG's Chad Gilbert discovered Paramore and produced their first album. He also married (and later divorced) Hayley Williams. The pop punk family tree is complicated!

### The Cover Album Madmen 📀
They've released more cover albums than some bands release regular albums:
- *From the Screen to Your Stereo* (1, 2, and 3!)
- Covered everything from *The Goonies* theme to "Kiss Me"
- They covered "Iris" by Goo Goo Dolls so well that people think it's their song

### The Catalyst Recording Hack 🎚️
For *Catalyst*, they recorded in Neal Avron's garage. The drums were in the living room. The neighbors... were not fans. The album went on to be their highest-charting release.

## Why They're Eternal 🔄

New Found Glory understood a fundamental truth: growing up doesn't mean growing out of feeling feelings. They've been singing about heartbreak, friendship, and finding yourself for 25+ years, and it never gets old because those experiences never stop happening.

They're also the most consistent band in punk. While peers went electronic, acoustic, or disappeared entirely, NFG kept making NFG albums. It's comfort food, and we need comfort food.

## The Jordan Pundik Phenomenon 🎤
Jordan's voice hasn't changed since 1997. Scientists are baffled. He claims it's because he never stopped singing. More likely: he made a deal with the pop punk gods.

## Essential Anthems 🎵
- "My Friends Over You"
- "Hit or Miss"
- "All Downhill from Here"
- "Understatement"
- "Head on Collision"
- "Don't Let Her Pull You Down"

## The Coral Springs Connection 🌴
Four of the five members went to the same high school in Coral Springs, Florida. They used to practice in Ian Grushka's parents' garage until his dad's car got egged by kids who hated the noise. The dad's response: "At least they're not doing drugs!"

## The Guitar Pick Economy 💰
Steve Klein throws approximately 200 guitar picks into the crowd per show. At roughly 2,000 shows, that's 400,000 picks. Somewhere, there's a collector with all of them.

## The Friends with Everyone Status 🤝
NFG is famously the nicest band in pop punk. They've never had beef with anyone. Even their ex-members come to shows. In the drama-filled world of pop punk, they're Switzerland.

## The Not Without a Fight Story 💪
After being dropped by Geffen Records, they funded *Not Without a Fight* themselves. It became their second-highest charting album. Take that, major labels!

## The Movie Soundtrack Kings 🎬
They've been on more movie soundtracks than they can remember. Personal favorite: "Head on Collision" in *Orange County*. They've never seen half the movies they're in.

## The Stage Dive Statistics 📊
Chad Gilbert holds the unofficial record for most stage dives by a guitarist while still playing. His guitar tech follows him into the crowd with a wireless pack. It's a beautiful, chaotic ballet.

## The Charity Champions ❤️
They've raised millions for various charities but never talk about it. The only reason we know is because the charities keep thanking them publicly and ruining their "tough guy" image.

## The Eternal Youth Secret ⚡
When asked how they maintain their energy after 25 years:
- Jordan: "We never stopped being 19 in our heads"
- Chad: "Stretching. So much stretching."
- Ian: "Denial"
- Cyrus: "Coffee and spite"

## The Perfect Attendance Award 🏅
In 25+ years, they've never canceled a tour. Food poisoning? Play through it. Broken bones? Tape it up. They're the postal service of pop punk – neither rain nor snow nor advancing age...

## The Legacy Move 🎖️
They started their own festival (Self Help Fest) to showcase bands they love. It's like Warped Tour if Warped Tour was run by the kids who actually went to Warped Tour.

## Still Finding Glory 🌅
The fact that New Found Glory still tours, still jumps around like maniacs, and still believes every word they're singing is proof that pop punk isn't a phase – it's a lifestyle. And they're living it better than anyone.
