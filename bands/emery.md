# Emery 🔥📖

**Active:** 2001-present
**Origin:** Rock Hill, South Carolina / Seattle, Washington
**Genre:** Post-hardcore, emo, screamo, alternative rock

## The Thinking Person's Screamo Band 🎓

Emery emerged from the Christian rock scene but quickly transcended any simple label. They're the band that proved you could scream about theology, broken relationships, and existential dread while maintaining actual melody. Think of them as the graduate school of post-hardcore.

## Deeply Interesting Nuggets 🎸

### The Dentist Connection 🦷
Before Emery, vocalist Toby Morrell was studying to become a dentist. He dropped out of dental school to scream for a living. His parents were thrilled (narrator: they were not thrilled).

### The Bad Christian Revolution ✝️😈
Emery members founded Bad Christian Media, a record label/podcast network that deliberately pushed against sanitized Christian culture. Their podcasts discuss everything from theology to horror movies to why Christian music often sucks. They basically became the punk rock of Christian media.

### The Wall of Death Incident 💀
At Cornerstone Festival 2005, Emery accidentally created one of the largest "walls of death" in Christian music history during "Studying Politics." Festival organizers were... concerned. The band was delighted.

### Two Singers, No Drama 🎤🎤
Having two lead vocalists (Toby Morrell and Devin Shelton) who regularly trade off could be a recipe for ego clashes. Instead, they've been best friends for over 20 years and host a podcast together about being middle-aged dads in a screamo band.

### The Studio That Almost Wasn't 🏠
They bought a house in Seattle to convert into a studio, only to discover it was previously used for... less legal activities. The renovation stories from their podcast are legendary, involving everything from finding weird hidden compartments to dealing with very confused former "customers."

## Why They're Essential 💡

Emery proved that post-hardcore could be smart without being pretentious. Their lyrics read like poetry (dark, complicated poetry), and they never dumbed down their message for mass appeal. They're philosophers who happen to have really good breakdowns.

They also showed that you could age gracefully in heavy music. While many of their peers either broke up or went soft, Emery kept evolving while maintaining their intensity. They're basically the wise elder statesmen of screamo.

## The Matt Carter Factor 🎨
Guitarist Matt Carter is secretly one of the most innovative musicians in post-hardcore. His riffs are instantly recognizable – melodic but never predictable, heavy but never generic. He's also a visual artist whose paintings are as chaotic and beautiful as his guitar work.

## Essential Chaos 🌪️
- "Walls"
- "The Ponytail Parades"
- "Studying Politics"
- "In Shallow Seas We Sail"
- "The Weak's End"
- "Piggy Bank"

## The Book Club Band 📚
Emery might be the only screamo band whose members regularly discuss Kierkegaard and C.S. Lewis between breakdowns. Their podcast "The BadChristian Podcast" has featured discussions on everything from systematic theology to why *The Office* is actually about purgatory.

## The Crowd Surfing Prohibition 🚫🏄
After multiple injuries (to both band and fans), Emery instituted a "no crowd surfing" policy at their shows in 2007. They lifted it in 2010 because, quote, "It was boring." Safety third!

## The Warped Tour Wisdom 🎪
Known for giving genuinely helpful advice to younger bands on Warped Tour, including:
- "Bring baby wipes. So many baby wipes."
- "Learn to love gas station coffee."
- "Your drummer will get heat stroke. Plan accordingly."

## The Unexpected Influence 🌊
Multiple hip-hop producers have sampled Emery tracks, making them unlikely contributors to the emo-rap revolution. The band's reaction: "Wait, we're cool now?"

## Still Going Strong 💪
While most of their 2000s peers have called it quits, Emery continues releasing music and touring. Their recent albums prove that you can be in your 40s and still make music that makes 20-year-olds want to punch walls (in a good way).
