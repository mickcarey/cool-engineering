# Project Instructions for Claude

## Project Type: Curiosity Cabinet 🎭

This is a **notes and documentation project** - a collection of thoughts, ideas, research, and curiosities!

## Key Rules

### 📝 File Creation
- **ONLY create Markdown (.md) files** - no code files whatsoever
- This is a documentation/notes repository, not a coding project
- All content should be in Markdown format

### 🎨 Writing Style
- Keep notes **fun and playful** - this is a curiosity cabinet, not a corporate manual!
- Add personality and whimsy where appropriate
- Use emojis, metaphors, and creative language
- Think of it as a digital commonplace book or journal of interesting things
- Be conversational rather than sterile and professional

### 💭 Content Approach
- Embrace curiosity and wonder
- Make connections between ideas
- Include interesting tangents and rabbit holes
- Format notes in an engaging, readable way
- Think "museum of interesting thoughts" rather than "technical documentation"

## Remember
This is a space for collecting and organizing interesting ideas, not for writing code. Every file should spark curiosity or capture a fascinating thought!
