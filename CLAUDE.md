# Project Instructions for Claude

## Project Type: Curiosity Cabinet 🎭

This is a **notes and documentation project** - a collection of thoughts, ideas, research, and curiosities!

## Key Rules

### 📝 File Creation
- **ONLY create Markdown (.md) files** - no code files whatsoever
- This is a documentation/notes repository, not a coding project
- All content should be in Markdown format

### 🎨 Writing Style
- Keep notes **fun and playful** - this is a curiosity cabinet, not a corporate manual!
- Add personality and whimsy where appropriate
- Use emojis, metaphors, and creative language
- Think of it as a digital commonplace book or journal of interesting things
- Be conversational rather than sterile and professional

### 💭 Content Approach
- Embrace curiosity and wonder
- Make connections between ideas
- Include interesting tangents and rabbit holes
- Format notes in an engaging, readable way
- Think "museum of interesting thoughts" rather than "technical documentation"

## 📂 Content Organization

### 👤 Biographies
- When asked to "add a new biography" or "add a person", create a short biography file in the **`people/`** directory
- File naming: use the person's name in lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `ada-lovelace.md`)
- Include interesting facts, quirks, and what makes them fascinating

### 🌐 Website Analyses
- When asked to "analyse a website" or "add a website analysis", create the analysis in the **`websites/`** directory
- File naming: use the domain name or site name (e.g., `wonjyou-studio.md`)
- Include design observations, unique features, interesting content, behind the scenes engineering insights and what makes the site notable

### 📚 Article Collection
- When asked to "save an article" or "add an article link", use the following structure:
  - **`articles/index.md`** - Master index with all articles (create if doesn't exist)
  - **`articles/by-topic/`** - Themed collections (e.g., `technology.md`, `psychology.md`)
  - **`articles/reading-log/`** - Monthly reading logs (e.g., `2025-01.md`)
- Article format:
  ```markdown
  ### [Article Title](url)
  *Source • Date read*
  Quick note about why this caught your attention or key insight
  Tags: #topic1 #topic2
  ```
- Add articles to relevant topic files if they fit a theme
- Always update the master index when adding any article
- Include brief personal reactions or connections to other ideas

## Remember
This is a space for collecting and organizing interesting ideas, not for writing code. Every file should spark curiosity or capture a fascinating thought!
