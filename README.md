# The Curiosity Cabinet 🗄️✨

*A collection of thoughts, research, and rabbit holes that spark my curiosity*

## What's Inside?

This is my digital commonplace book – a place where I collect interesting ideas, fascinating people, weird facts, and all the "wait, what?" moments that make life worth exploring. Think of it as that drawer where you keep things too interesting to throw away.

**The collection includes:**
- 🧠 Research deep-dives and half-formed theories
- 👥 Stories of fascinating people
- 🌐 Website analyses and digital archaeology
- 🔮 Random curiosities and delightful tangents
- 💡 Questions that lead to more questions

## How to Explore

No map needed – just wander! Pick a folder, follow a link, get lost. The best discoveries happen when you're not looking for them.
